# Project Title

Justification of Police Shootings

## Motivation

There is a lot of distrust for the police in the Black community in America. Tensions between Black Americans and the police reached its peak in 2020 following the arrest and death of George Floyd in the hands of the police, which was caught on camera. 

Although George Floyd’s death didn’t result from a shooting incident, it showed evidence of police high-handedness when dealing with Black Americans, a circumstance which the Black Lives Matter movement has been trying to change. Also, for the first time, many Americans watched with horror as their police exercised force to deal with peaceful prostesters, firing rubber bullets, stun guns and tear gas to intimidate them.

Based on this, we decided to conduct an analysis of police shooting incidents in America from 2015 to date to ascertain if the shootings were necessary and could have been avoided. From the insights that will be derived, we aim to provide recommendations for the police and the citizens on what to do in an arrest situation, where both parties are usually tensed, to prevent avoidable fatalities.
